# Cycle GAN

Implementation of the paper Unpaired image to image translation using cylce consistent Adversarial Loss

The paper focusses on learning how to translate image from type A to type B, without using paired samples. Traditional
Models tend to use paired samples. Example of paired samples: image of a ground in winter, image of same ground in summer.<br>

# Future Plan
Currently gathering data of edited and non edited photos of similar places. A cycle GAN based approach can help automate the
process of editing in images that have similar features like similar backgrounds, light conditions etc.

###### Might Work Might Not Work, will give a try though :P
